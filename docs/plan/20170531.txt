Final Project -- Wok Wok 
2018-05-31

It's most important right now to make sure our preparating is in order
and to get verification (a green light) from Mr. Brown so that we can
begin fleshing out the particulars of our project. Mr. Brown says that
our project proposal sounds close to viability, which means we can start
making more detailed UML diagrams to consider each of the elements that
our simulation will need to run and achieve the tasks at hand.

Core functionality constitutes a vanilla simulation so that we know the
basics of our program works. The most important elements so far are
that each customer orders one item only, that there is a set amount of
customers that need to be dealt with each time, that the line of customers
is a queue (priority queue to be implemented later on), and that the
simulation ends when there are no more customers in the queue.

A task that must be collaboratively tackled is our UML diagrams because
we all need to be on the same page about how the classes interact with
one another and that we have the same visualization of how the simulation
works. The driver class must also be worked on collaboratively, but writing 
the individual Cook and Customer classes and other small components can be
delegated.
