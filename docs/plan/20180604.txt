Final Project -- Wok Wok 
2018-06-04

We've updated our UML diagram after receiving valuable feedback from Mr. Brown to clean it up. We added new elements (inst vars, methods) that we saw would be useful in the design of the program (i.e. modularity). The most important task right now is to work on putting together the most basic version of this simulation in order to launch by Monday evening. 

In order to try to meet our deadline of Monday evening, we have planned a session in the csDojo for Monday afternoon. Raymond will use the Issues tab to send an alert at 11:30a as a reminder. In addition, he is using the Projects tab in order to keep track of the tasks that must be completed prior to launching v1. 

We will focus on core functionality in our first version. As outlined in our proposal, our first version will consist of a simulation with a predetermined amount of customers in which each customer orders one item only. We will expand on this concept by randomizing the amount of customers to be dealt with and the amount of items a customer orders, but we only want to implement these features after we know that the most basic conceptualization of our simulation works. 

We will finalize on Monday the days in which we will coordinate in the csDojo (aside from Monday) and the times we will coordinate on Tuesday and Thursday.
